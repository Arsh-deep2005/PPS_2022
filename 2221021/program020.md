## Program 20: Write a program for greater than or even.
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
    int x=3;
    if((x>2) &&(x%2==0))
     {
        printf("x is greater than 2 and even");
       }
       else{
            printf("x is not greater than 2 or even");
        
    }
   return 0;
}
```
**Output: x is not greater than 2 or even.**
